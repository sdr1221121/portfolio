# Overview

This project was developed for the **Database and Web Applications Laboratory** course, where our group was given the task of creating an entire website from scratchâ€”from designing the requirements and defining the actors, to actually building the website.

The website is a clone of the famous daily.dev website.

# What did I do?

I was involved, as I should be, in every step of the development process. Together, we designed what each actor would be responsible for. At one point, we even had a question about one of the actors, specifically related to Google's OAuth. We weren't sure if it should be treated as an actor just like the others or handled differently.

Moving on to the database specification: **I remember spending several hours creating the UML diagram and working with another teammate to determine the normalization of each functional dependency.** After that, we spent some time defining triggers and deciding whether they were well-placed, or if the logic should be moved to a higher layer.

During development, **I was mostly responsible for the search functionality on the website and the admin dashboard.** Since our group was relatively small and we didn't have much experience, **I also spent a lot of time helping my colleagues solve their issues while working on mine**.

After we delivered the project, I felt satisfied with the work we had done. Even though there were some stressful moments, the result was worth it.

# What have I learned?

I learned how to work with a new framework, which was cool, but **the main takeaway from this experience was improving my management skills**. Since the project was medium-sized and had to be completed in less than a semester, we needed to be precise in terms of dividing responsibilities and managing time.

**We faced some team issues during development and had to sit down and talk about how to work better together and actually get the product finished.**

One thing I can definitely say I've learned is that **making a less-than-perfect decision is better than making no decision at all**.

# Would I do something differently?

This was a project where I truly learned a lot, in terms of technical stuff and soft skills, so there's not much I'd change.

Maybe I would improve the organization and division of responsibilities a bit more so we could have delivered even more functionality.
