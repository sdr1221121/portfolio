# What did I do?

**Contributing to this project was a challenge for me, since I had never even touched anything like it**, so first I had to learn how it worked and a little about the technologies involved. For that, **I started with the Kubernetes Bootcamp on their website, some Docker tutorials and a lot of documentation from the Ansible team**.

Even after all of that, my contributions were somewhat sub-optimal and I wish I had made more contributions (which I plan to do this next academic year). **My real contributions were setting up a DHCP server and fixing an issue with a failsafe protocol.**

# What have I learned?

Even if my contributions were not really significant, **I feel like I've learned tons about DevOps, GitHub Actions and everything related to infrastructure and how all of that works**.

For that, I give my sincere thanks to [Luis Duarte](https://github.com/LuisDuarte1/) and [Jos√© Costa](https://github.com/Sirze01), who were the minds behind the whole project and **the people who fueled even more my passion for working on something great**.

# Would I do something differently?

I would probably give more of my time to contribute and be more involved in this project.
