# What did I do?

Alongside my co-coordinator of projects at the Informatics Club, we took the **leadership** role for this project and were **responsible for organizing tasks** and what was to be done in the project.

Aside from this, we were on the development team so I contributed to all parts of the project. I was the one responsible for most of the **Payload CMS integration** and participated in the development of **all of the pages** on the website.

# What have I learned?

My main takeaways from this project were **leadership and organization skills.** As one of the people at the head of the project, I had to be able to contribute and, at the same time, organize the team.

Another important thing that I learned was that **motivation** is really important within a team and sometimes it may be more of a challenge than I thought.

# Would I do something differently?

If I could, I would probably spend more of my time organizing the project in terms of which tasks were more important and should be implemented, which was the main issue during development.
