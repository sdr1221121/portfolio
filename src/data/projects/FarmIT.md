# **FarmIT – Digital Agricultural Assistant**

## **Overview**

**FarmIT** is a digital agricultural assistant developed within the Computer Engineering programme for *Sociedade Agrícola Casal da Cotovia* (Portugal).

Portuguese agriculture faces ongoing challenges, including rising production costs and labour shortages. This project addresses these issues by proposing a digital solution that manages the farm efficiently, reduces waste, and increases productivity.

An initial domain analysis identified key problems such as manual activity logging and low levels of digitalisation, which affect operational efficiency and decision-making.

## **Objectives**

The main objective is to develop an accessible, scalable, and sustainable digital assistant tailored to small and medium-sized farms, with potential for continuation beyond the prototype phase.

## **Key Features**

The solution follows principles of modularity, scalability, security, and usability, using the *Domain-Driven Design* (DDD) pattern. Key features include:

- User authentication and role-based access control
- Daily activity logging and visualisation
- Agricultural planning with crop recommendations
- Integration of weather data
- Support chatbot

## **Technologies**

- **Backend:** Java with Spring Boot
- **Frontend:** Next.js with TypeScript
- **Database:** SQL using JPA (*Java Persistence API*)
- **Deployment:** Docker containers for portability
- **Design Principles:** SOLID, GRASP, and *Clean Architecture* were applied to ensure high-quality design

## **Individual Contribution**

Full responsibility was assumed for backend development, including:

- Sensor integration
- Implementation of recommendation algorithms for irrigation and fertigation
- Automatic alerts setup
- Contribution to the user interface and system improvement based on feedback

The contribution also included:

- In-depth analysis of agricultural domain needs
- Design of a modular, scalable, and secure system based on DDD and *Clean Architecture*
- Application of SOLID and GRASP principles
- Docker-based deployment for environment consistency

## **Key Learnings**

The project enabled valuable learning, both technical and interpersonal. Key takeaways include:

- Practical application of DDD, *Clean Architecture*, SOLID, and GRASP in a real-world context
- Full lifecycle development using agile, iterative, and incremental approaches
- Interdisciplinary collaboration with students and lecturers from computer science, agronomy, and management
- Design of user-friendly and economically viable tools for farmers with varying digital skills

## **Future Improvements**

Although the prototype meets the intended goals, the final report outlines areas for improvement under “Limitations and Future Work”:

- Extension of functionalities beyond the original scope
- Integration with regulatory entities and external APIs
- Iterative improvements based on ongoing user feedback

The focus remains on building a robust, sustainable, and impactful solution for the agricultural sector.
