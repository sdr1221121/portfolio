# Overview

This project represents the beginning of my journey of **learning Golang**. I wanted to implement something relatively reasonable but also **interesting** and after searching for a little bit it seemed like a good starting point.

# Technologies and Categories

- Golang
- Make
- Docker
- Viper (for configuration)

# What did I do?

Aside from most projects presented here, this was all me. From defining the interface to configurating files to the actual implementation.

First, I started by defining the **simulated network** with different virtual machines using **Docker**. Then, I integrated **Viper**, a package to facilitate the integration of configuration files (yaml) and finally actually implemented the server.

# What have I learned?

I learned a lot about the **Go language syntax** and some of its perks. Before starting this project I thought I had some idea of what the experience of writing Go was (from smaller projects) but it seemed somehow different.

Another thing that I "discovered" was that I want to keep exploring this and work on something interesting and more challenging.

# Would I do something differently?

If I could do it from scratch again, I'd probably use more complex structures and elements to create a more robust (and more verbose) codebase. But I also understand that this would slow down the project being finished.
