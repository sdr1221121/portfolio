# What did I do?

Since I started contributing to this project, **most of my work was finishing and closing open PRs on the repository**. The website's backend is already very robust, which gave me the opportunity to experience a well-rounded Spring Boot project, with proper documentation and proper testing.

On the frontend, I was responsible for **one of the pages and helped people who are working on the team**.

# What have I learned?

This project has introduced me to Spring Boot and showed me how a robust and clean project looks like. The people before me did a great job and **I personally appreciate a lot working on this project**.

# Would I do something differently?

As I'm currently contributing to this project, I can't really talk about what I would do differently, but I plan to keep contributing.
