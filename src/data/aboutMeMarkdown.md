**Hey, my name is Rubem Neto.** I'm just a guy who loves to learn and explore new things. Ever since I was a kid, I've always been curious,constantly diving into new ideas and asking lots of "why?". For me, a question without an answer is just a challenge waiting for someone to figure it out.

I was born in **Brazil** in 2004. I love my country deeply and hope to visit my family and friends there as often as I can. There's something special about being around the people and places that shaped who you are.

Since I was little, I’ve been into puzzles and anything that pushes my brain a bit. One of my first experiences with that was through math in school. There wasn't much going on in class most of the time, so I ended up exploring the textbooks and reading ahead just out of curiosity. Looking back, **I’m really grateful to my younger self** for doing that because, without that curiosity and initiative, I probably wouldn’t be where I am now.

When I moved to Portugal in 2019, I got the chance to meet a lot of amazing people who are also into tackling new challenges and even more importantly, into working together and collaborating. For me, **collaboration is incredibly important**. With the right team, anything feels possible.

# What am I working on now?

I’m currently working on strategies to **better organize myself** so I can take more value from my time. So if you have any book recomendations or strategies to improve organization and time management, please hit me up.

# Motivation

There are **three big things** that drive me:

1. **Learning** - Every day is a chance to **learn something new**, and that’s what keeps life exciting. Discovering new things helps keep our minds fresh and open to even more learning. It’s a cycle I really enjoy being part of.

2. **Helping people** - I want to work on things that actually **make a difference in people’s lives**, even if it’s something small. Making someone’s day just a little bit better feels meaningful to me.

3. **My mother** - She’s been my rock and my guide through life. None of this would’ve been possible without her support and love. One of my biggest dreams is to give her the comfortable and happy life she truly deserves.

# Personal Interests

I’m a big fan of sci-fi **especially Star Wars**. There’s something about those stories that mixes imagination with deeper ideas about life, humanity, and the future.

I also enjoy **watching movies**, especially dramas or more introspective and experimental films. I love stories that make you think or feel something real.

Another thing I love is **going for walks** and just taking in nature. It makes me feel connected to the world in a peaceful way. It’s my way of slowing down and recharging.
